The game I played most is Free Fire.I started playing it on 23 july,2020 in grameenphone's tab.I like clash squad mode more than battle royale mode.
34 kill in battle royale mode,14 kill in br-ranked mode is my highest.I like to play with sub-machine guns like mp40,mp5,ump.I like to rush and kill all the enemies alone.
I made 3000+ br matches and 17000+ cs match.I did triple kill 950+ times & quadra kill 150+ tmes in cs mode.My headshot rate is about 20% in both cs & br lifetime.My K/D ratio is about 1.00+ in br & 1.50+ in cs lifetime.
I reached  heroic 9 times in cs-ranked & 5 times in br-ranked mode.
<p>My overall experience in Free Fire is not so good.I don't have any smartphone till now.
I played it mostly on my father's mobile Redmi Note-8.But it is not enough good mobile for playing Free Fire.Moreover we use wi-fi of other people those are far from where I play.
Furthermore,as it is ban in Bangladesh,I have to use vpn.So internet connection is too much slow.That's why I couldn't play well.when I played it on my mother's mobile Realme C20, 
I uninstalled Free Fire approximately 50 times because of anger,unpleasantness,failure,despair.Because it is a 2GB ram mobile that can't run the game well.</p>
<p>However I have some sweet memories with this game.Whenever I win a intense fighting match or something happens that I not expected I get pleasure.I have some rare dresses,
avater,banner and so on.I uploaded some videos on youtube of this game those I watch often.I still wish, I will become a pro player one day.</p>
